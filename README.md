# GTM-Analytics-Dashboard
This GTM Analytics Dashboard transforms customer reviews and sentiment data into actionable insights for Go-To-Market (GTM) strategy.
Unlike static reports, this is a **dynamic dashboard** with:

* **Slicers/Filters** for Year, Month, Product, and Sentiment Category.
* **Granularity controls** (drill down from yearly to monthly to product-level insights).
* **Interactive visuals** where users can pivot data in real time.

This ensures GTM teams can **slice and dice customer feedback** to align with campaigns, product categories, and timeframes.

## GTM Goals

2. **Measure Campaign Effectiveness** – Track how marketing efforts shift sentiment.
3. **Guide Product Positioning** – Identify top-performing vs. underperforming products.
4. **Boost Retention & Growth** – Spot detractors early while leveraging advocates for upsell.
